# Difference between C and C++

## Similarities

- Similar syntax. Nearly all C's operators and keywords are in C++
- Code structure are same
- Compilation is similar
- Basic grammar is the same
- Memory model is very close hardware
- Same notations of stack, heap, file-scope, and static variables

## Differences 

C++ can be seen as a upgraded C with Oject-Oriented Programming, Exception Handling, and richer Library
- C++ supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance
- C++ is an object-driven language while C is function-driven
- C++ allow both built-in and user-defined datatype
- C++ allow function and operator overloading
- C++ allow data hidden by Encapsulation
- C++ support reference variables
- C++ provides new operator for memory allocation and delet operator for memory de-allocation while C provides malloc() and calloc() for dynamic memory allocation, and free for memory de-allocation
